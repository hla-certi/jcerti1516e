jcerti is a Java Binding for the CERTI HLA RTI.
jcerti is SISO DLC compliant.  
CERTI must be installed before jcerti.


INSTALL/COMPILING INSTRUCTION
-----------------------------
As a prerequisite, the following software should be installed
 - Sun Java JDK (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads)
 - Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)
 - xml-commons (http://xml.apache.org/commons)

Linux users, please make sure the appropriate 'javac' alternative is used.

FIXME: keep these lines about Sun JDK?
Enable the javac alternative from Sun JDK using:
update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" javac "/usr/java/jdk1.6.0_19/bin/javac" 1
update-alternatives --set javac /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_19/bin/javac

jcerti comes with a build.xml ant file
(see http://ant.apache.org/manual/)

Thus building jcerti should be as simple as unpacking the source
and calling (at jcerti folder)
"ant" 

with no argument.

If you want more help about possible ant target just type
"ant -p"


RUNNING TEST INSTRUCTION
-------------------------
Before running jcerti example you should have C++ CERTI installed
http://www.nongnu.org/certi/certi_doc/Install/html/index.html

(or if you are a CERTI C++ developer you can just define
 CERTI_HOST and CERTI_HOME env variables and update PATH in order to make rtia/rtig executable automatically reachable)


RUNNING TEST USING HLA 1516-2010 EVOLVED (jcerti/src_test/certi1516e)
----------------------------------------

Shipped with jcerti 1516E there is currently small tests. Each federate must be
executed in a different terminal.

Federation "uav" with 1 federate OneFederateTAR.java: 
=====================================================

1) in a first terminal run rtig
2) in a second terminal run "ant -DtimeStep=2   -DupdateTime=1 -Dlookahead=0.5 oneTAR-run" (press enter)

You can replace 'oneTAR-run' by 'oneTAR_RTI'. This federate launch the rtig and step 1) above is not needed.

Federation "uav" with 2 federates EvokeMCmin/UavSend.java and EvokeMCmin/UavReceive.java: (using EvokeMultipleCallbacks)
=============================================================================

1) in a first terminal run rtig
2) in a second terminal run "ant -DtimeStep=2   -DupdateTime=1 -Dlookahead=0.5 UAVSend_1516e_MinEvokeMCUAV" (press enter)
3) in a third terminal run "ant -DtimeStep=13 -DupdateTime=5 -Dlookahead=1 UAVReceive_1516e_MinEvokeMCUAV" (press enter)
Then go back to terminal T2 and press Enter again.

See build.xml for other tests. See the code in jcerti/src_test/certi1516e for more details.


RUNNING TEST USING HLA 1.3 (jcerti/src_test/certi)
--------------------------

Shipped with jcerti there is currently a small UAV Send/Receive test.
If you want to try this you should:

1) in a first terminal run rtig
2) in a second terminal run "ant UAVSend-run"
3) in a second terminal run "ant UAVReceive-run"
