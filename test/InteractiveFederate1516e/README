Summary
The InteractiveFederation is composed of a various number of interactive federates.
These federates can use the 1.3 or IEEE 1516-2000 or IEEE 1516-2010 standard.
Each federate has a loop around an interactive menu that allows the user
to call the main HLA services, to test ou to understand them.
Type h for help.
The user can do mistakes, the exceptions are catched.
This code can be read do see how each call is done in C++.
An (optional) automatic preamble corresponds to a suite of calls for the
initialization phase of the federate.

To develop the federate :
- choose a subdirectory
- set up the CERTI environment
- make 
The makefile is deliberately very simple (one target and four lines).
(And source directory = install directory = execution directory)

To execute the federation
In different terminals, with the CERTI environment and the good working directory:
rtig
./InteractiveFederate one
./InteractiveFederate two
...

To do:
to use all the HLA services
